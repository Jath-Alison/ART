ART aims to be a easy to use and flexible VexCode Library that provides teams with powerful tools while also being a valuable resource to the Vex community.

## Project Goals

The main goal of ART is to allow newer teams to explore and apply several of the powerful features commonly used within the Vex Robotics Competiton. Alongside the library itself, a major goal is to creat sufficient documentation and explanation for teams to fully understand the concepts they a are utilizing in thier code. This allows competitors to utilize the library for competition while abiding to \<G2\> (V5RC is a student-centered program) and allows them to grow thier knowledge and apply it outside of VRC.

Aside from that, ART is also just a way to *finally* publish code that I've been putting off for the last couple years. Most of the first few versions of ART will be classes and features I developed for competition on various Astrobots teams over the past few years. After that, I hope to develop additional features and systems based on feedback from the community, allowing me to prioritize features that the community deems useful.

Finally, apart from just releasing it, ART mainly is and was just a passion project, with the main users being local teams I can provide direct support to. However, I hope to provide support to whoever wants to use this Template even once I graduate.

## Project Lifetime and Development plans

ART will release in multiple minor versions as it grows and more features are added. Features should be compatible with previous versions, but some features may result in major reworks and a brand new version will release instead.

I only really have plans for a few initial versions and a few much later ones, so a lot of features will likely come from the community and what they want.

## Features

### V1.0 (Initial Version):
- TankDrive wrapper class
  - Odometry
  - Several motion functions
- PID control class
- Vector Utility Class
- Unit Utility Classes

### Features planned for future versions:
- Smarter Motor Control class
- Sensor Wrapper classes
- Path Utility class
  - Pure Pursuit
  - [PATH.JERRYIO](path.jerryio.com) support
- Macros and Auton support classes
- Custom Timer class
